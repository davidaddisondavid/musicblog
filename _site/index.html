<p>Welcome to the beginning of a website. <br>
  
  I don't know what this will end up being, but for now there's a blog and a weekly-updated list of gigs happening in London.</p>

<p>
  I named the website after the EP <em>Howl or Buzz Under The Influence of Heat</em> by the Minutemen, honestly because I was looking through what I'd listened to recently, 
  and thought that it made for a cool name. But, if I was lying, I'd say that it's because I want this website to be like a punk zine, something made out of love and obsession for music, people and places – 
  held together with all the html knowledge I've scraped together in the last few weeks. <br>

  I hope that this site can be your life.

  <strong> This week </strong> I'm obsessed with this recording of Silver Jews' performance at Green Man 2006. David Berman is such a warm and funny presence in this show (a rare live performance for the band).
  I came across it via a reference on Jokermen podcast, they were talking about the album 'Tanglewood Numbers' and specifically an extra verse for 'Animal Shapes', which surfaces briefly in this performance.
