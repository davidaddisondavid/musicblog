<p>Welcome to the beginning of a website. <br>
  
  I don't know what this will end up being, but for now there's a blog and a weekly-updated list of gigs happening in London.</p>

<p>
  I named the website after the EP <em>Howl or Buzz Under The Influence of Heat</em> by the Minutemen, honestly because I was looking through what I'd listened to recently, 
  and thought that it made for a cool name. But, if I was lying, I'd say that it's because I want this website to be like a punk zine, something made out of love and obsession for music, people and places – 
  held together with all the html knowledge I've scraped together in the last few weeks. <br>

  I hope that this site can be your life.

  <strong> This week </strong> I'm obsessed with the song 'Trem 2' by Mission of Burma. 
  It's based around an undulating guitar riff played through a tremolo pedal, intertwined with a disco drum pattern: 
  there's lots of noise and punk rock sharpness, but it's also so so groovy.

  I'm also loving a new york band called tal castle: their music is very playful, with a bunch of instruments and quirky production.
  it's full of soul and arranged beautifully, with tonnes of space and atmosphere.
