<h1 id='week'>Jan 26 - Feb 1</h1>

<p class='intro'>

    It's a crazy stacked week, lots of great shows happening for Independent Venue Week including many that are already sold out, which I haven't included here but will be phenomenal if you've got tickets. Tuesday in particular seems super loaded, you can't go wrong!

</p>

<h2 class='date'>Monday 26th</h2>

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/7dqk86-tgt-ivw-spanish-horses-august-jackson-roy-26th-jan-the-george-tavern-london-tickets'>George Tavern: Spanish Horses / August / Jackson Roy</a>

First in a series of IVW shows at the George. Headlined by Spanish Horses, one of the best out and out rock bands in London - great songwriting and a tight, high energy live set. I haven't seen either of the other bands but they seem fresh & cool – August seem especially theatrical and fun.            


<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/ww5kkn-leatherhead-broadsheets-3d-jesus-vera-sacra-26th-jan-sebright-arms-london-tickets'>Sebright Arms: Leather.head / Broadsheets / 3D Jesus / VERA SACRA</a>

Headliners leather.head are a band of siblings from Brighton who make 'janky, sort of amateur math-rock or emo with with a horn section'. I'm including this gig in part because of a strong reccomendation from my friend Heinos, who says: 'Leatherhead has been making cool stuff for a while now, super consistent. Vera Sacra has a really cool sound, her EP from last year is enchanting.'

Deloyd Elze is an electronically enhanced country artist / poet usually based in Los Angeles - over in London for just a little while. I saw him at SXSW last year and loved it, super unique sound and a very cool approach to live performance, reading poetry in between songs so that it all flows into one. 

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://riocinema.org.uk/Rio.dll/WhatsOn?f=1884927'>Rio Cinema: LSFF, Lo-Budget Mayhem</a>

Quick film shout for this years edition of The London Short Film Festival's Lo-Budget cinema night - promising a 'cracking collection of oddities, hand-crafted from the confines of our empty wallets and our mortal bodies.'

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/yo6bbv-shovel-dance-collective-27th-jan-elgar-room-at-royal-albert-hall-london-tickets'>Albert Hall Elgar Room: Shovel Dance Collective</a>

First and only time the Royal Albert Hall will get a shout on this page? Granted, it's the smaller Elgar Room, but I think Shovel Dance Collective are ambitous and epic enough to warant the big hall itself. They are a London-based folk collective, deeply passionate about folk music history but eager to steer it into new directions. 

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/2wk9xp-ivw-2026-louis-ohara-osgled-gem-stark-27th-jan-morocco-bound-london-tickets'>Morrocco Bound: Louis O’Hara / Osgled / Gem Stark</a>

Brilliant week of gigs at Morocco Bound in Bermondsey – a small bookshop/cafe which I used to visit nearly every day when I lived around there. This night is headlined by Welsh artist Louis O'Hara, a talented songwriter, folk artist and lovely guy.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/538bkk-hello-2026-silver-gore-27th-jan-the-old-blue-last-london-tickets'>Silver Gore / Lover's Skit / Pearl2 / Pollyfromthedirt</a>

Last of DIY's 2026 showcases, which have all had awesome lineups – this last one maybe the best of them. Headlined by the alt-pop duo Silver Gore - extremely creative & technically skilled but having so much fun with it – joined by the trancey acidy Pearl2, and the mysterious but enchanting Pollyfromthedirt - I wrote about their latest single in a <a target=_blank href='https://buzzorhowl.com/Roundup-24-1/'>roundup blog post</a>, I think they're really exciting and well worth getting down early for. It's probably worth getting here early in any case, because the Old Blue Last is very small and these bands are very, very good.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/6dwg78-officer-john-max-winter-fly-the-nest-27th-jan-below-stone-nest-london-tickets'>Stone nest: Officer John / Max Winter</a>

Officer John makes music which is part shoegaze / part 90s baggy , a bit like George Clanton - he released 'The Return of Officer John' last year and he now returns to London, playing at the Stone Nest with Max Winter - a jazzy, deconstructive experimental-pop artist, one of my favourite artists playing regularly at the moment, catch him while u can.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/7dpomv-ivw-2026-misty-miller-glass-eel-anna-mcluckie-28th-jan-morocco-bound-london-tickets'>Morocco Bound: Misty Miller / Glass Eel / Anna McLuckie</a>

Good times keep on coming at Morocco Bound, I especially like Glass Eel - a folk band who play with a Shruti box (an acoustic drone generator which is a bit like an accordion without any keys, or a tiny harmonium). I saw them play last year and I remember in particular a great song about a man frying an egg on a Thames beach.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/6dwoq3-dean-rodney-and-the-cowboys-28th-jan-the-ivy-house-london-tickets'>Ivy House: Dean Rodney and The Cowboys / Big World / bog band</a>

Check out Dean Rodney and the Cowboys' <a target=_blank href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLlYgjcCKDU'>State 51 live session</a> - it's mad and brilliant, funny groovy disco-pop, there's maybe elements of Ian Dury and the Blockheads. Also very exciting that bog band are supporting, I <a target=_blank href='https://buzzorhowl.com/Best-of-2025/'>LOVED their album 'Moschano Days' from last year</a> - really clever and fresh new-wavey pop.

Another folk night at Morocco Bound, with Avice Caro's heartfelt, vintage folk balladry - she released two albums  last year, one of them a live recording of her show at St Pancras Live Church, and both are among the best folk releases of 2025. 

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/6dwap8-ivw-mortagh-max-winter-holden-doberman-late-set-29th-jan-dream-bags-jaguar-shoes-london-tickets'>Dream Bags Jaguar Shoes: Mortagh / Max Winter / Holden / DOBERMAN</a>

Interesting night of alternative rap and electronic music in the Dream Bags Jaguar Shoes Basement. Max Winter opens again, along with the spoken word artist Holden - the night is headlined by alt rapper Mortagh and his band. 

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/eobp3w-insomnia-london-closing-party-29th-jan-corsica-studios-london-tickets'>Corsica Studios: Insomnia Closing Party</a>

It's not long until Corsica Studios shuts for good! Insomnia London has been one of the longest running events at the club: this Thursday they celebrate their 3rd Birthday and host a Closing Party, ahead of Corsica's permanent closure at the end of March. Well worth getting to Corsica before it shuts, and this would be a fitting night to go. 

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/6dnml3-moodod-presents-la-touche-franaise-29th-jan-experimental-cocktail-club-chinatown-london-tickets'>Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown: Laetitia Sadier (Stereolab) and Paula (PPJ) DJ sets</a>

At the other end of the DJ spectrum, the newly reopened classy bar / soundsystem 'Experimental Cocktail Club Chinatown' hosts a celebration of French music with sets from Stereolab founding member Laetitia Sadier and Paula from the French/Brazilian techno-pop grouo PPJ.

A show for the end of a residency at Peckham's IKLEKTIC art centre - featuring, among other WIP performances, excerpts from The Masks We Wear, 'a monodrama for singer, electronics, & video'.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/92ww27-ivw-drive-your-plow-henry-coke-the-scuttlers-m-30th-jan-windmill-brixton-london-tickets'>Windmill Brixton: Drive Your Plow / Henry Coke / The Scuttlers / Magnolia</a>

Classic Windmill IVW stuff, outside of the big name headline shows hapenning across the week this is one of the annual stacked bills of Windmill regulars and exciting new talents. There's a folk-rock theme to this lineup, with headliners Drive Your Plow, a sprawling folk-jazz band, and choral alt-pop artist Henry Coke - those two have shared lots of lineups here and its always great.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/oeq8gy-martial-artsgodzookigoose-princesscharlie-keen-30th-jan-sebright-arms-london-tickets'>Sebright Arms: Martial Arts / Godzooki / Goose Princess / Charlie Keen</a>

Visiting from Manchester, Martial Arts are a raw and dynamic art-punk group. Their shows are non-stop and very dynamic, they kind of attack their guitars, but in a skilled & deliberate way - like martial artists.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/l8bnob-ivw-spitzer-space-telescope-the-pig-31st-jan-theatreship-london-tickets'>Theatreship: Spitzer Space Telescope / The Pig</a>

I saw Spitzer Space Telescope last year at Green an, performing as part of a Bob Dylan tribute set. He's got a proper old-school folksinger's twang to his voice and a talent for reviving old, forgotten tunes. 

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/v3q93d-ivw-babydoll-deadbeat-wing-mm99-lifeloose-n-31st-jan-windmill-brixton-london-tickets'>Windmill Brixton: Babydoll Deadbeat / Wing! / MM'99 / Lifeloose / Nadim</a>

Another stellar Windmill IVW lineup, this time showcasing the dance/electronic side of the scene which has really been in ascendence over the last year or so - Babydoll Deadbeat and wing! are among the very best of the bunch.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/wwr2lx-ivw-2026-heka-lando-manning-evelyn-gray-1st-feb-morocco-bound-london-tickets'>Morrocco Bound: heka / Lando Manning / Evelyn Gray</a>

Last in a whole week of great nights at Morocco Bound: headlined by multidisciplinary folk/electronic artist Heka, joined by Lando Manning and Evelyn Gray, formerly of tapir!, who is starting a new project inspired by the rooms of an abandoned apartment block.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/2wkrxp-ivw-otala-curser-auntie-1st-feb-sebright-arms-london-tickets'>Sebright Arms: Otala / Curser / Auntie</a>

Three raucous and raw groups, 5-piece Otala bring in elements of jazz, while Auntie feature one member on banjo. Curser are a hard & loud funky rock trio.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/bbxrvg-tgt-ivw-morn-terracettes-the-wheel-2-blousey-1st-feb-the-george-tavern-london-tickets'>George Tavern: Morn / Terracettes / The Wheel 2! / Blousey</a>

The end of IVW at the George, headlined by the fast-rising Welsh post-punk band Morn. I'd give a big reccomendation also to The Wheel 2, whose sets blast through multiple songs and genres at an exhilirating pace.
