<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/eob92y-new-music-monday-20262-19th-jan-windmill-brixton-london-tickets'>Windmill Brixton: New Music Mondays</a>

Another entry in the Windmill's popular series, bands who play New Music Mondays have passed through the discerning filter of the venue's in house booker, so the lineup is consistently fresh, varied and top-quality. In the last couple of years it's been one of the best nights to catch the first show of a brilliant new band.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/g5ka8b-hello-2026-dog-race-20th-jan-the-old-blue-last-london-tickets'>Old Blue Last: Dog Race / Y / Jeanie & The White Boys / Bande á Part</a>

This week's edition of DIY's 2026 showcase: Dog Race headline, a glittery new-wave electro-goth band full of energy and shadows; alongside big jam band 'Y', punks 'Jeanie & the White Boys' and art-rockers 'Bande a Part'. Get down early because the Old Blue Last is very small and these bands are very good.

Oxford Street's 100 Club is best known as a historic punk venue, but it began life in the 1940s as the Feldman Swing Club. In January they're returning to the venue's roots by putting on a series of jazz nights. Although I'd say this show, with Newcastle jazz band Knats and saxophonist Kaidi Akinnibi, also has echoes of the 100 Club's punk spirit. Knats 'pride themselves on playing Newcastle’s homegrown Geordie jazz, known for its deep, danceable drum’n‘bass grooves and infectious, aggressive melodies' (<a target=_blank href='https://downbeat.com/news/detail/knats-from-newcastle-with-lotsa-love'>link to interview</a>).

Excellent bill at the Grace, promoted by busy doing nothing. Truthpaste have one of the most fun and charming live sets around at the moment, they make arty folktronica with strings, synths and a drum machine - I love how they intergrate the drum programming into their performance and kind of huddle around the laptop. The Last Whole Earth Catalog is an ever changing project led by Dan Parr, a brilliant and prolific singer-songwriter.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://www.thehorsehospital.com/events/my-new-band-believe-caius-williams'>Horse Hospital: My New Band Believe / Caius Williams</a>

Another workshop show for MNBB at the Horse Hospital, this time with a lineup featuring acoustic guitars, upright bass, viola and cittern (a pear shaped string instrument, similar to what you might imagine a medieval troubadour playing). Bassist Caius Williams will play a solo set to open. Exciting prospect to hear these songs in this arrangement!

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/926vg7-love-tutorial-auntie-samuel-22nd-jan-windmill-brixton-london-tickets'>Windmill Brixton: Love Tutorial / Auntie / Samuel</a>

Headliners Love Tutorial are aparently inspired by the novels of Don DeLillo and the albums of Prefab Sprout. They've got a few releases on bandcamp, which remind me a bit of Guided By Voices and that cool thing when the ambition of the music exceeds the fidelity of the recording - they make sincere bangers. They're joined by art rockers Auntie - with a very good balance of art and rock.

Lovely night at the lovely Ivy House in Nunhead, headlined by the 5-piece indie folk group Bojockey, along with Bone China - a brand new Slacker Rock band, who've been on some cool lineups since debuting late last year – the bits and pieces I've heard on their instagram sound cool.
