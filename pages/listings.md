<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href= 'https://dice.fm/event/eobynw-hello-2026-shes-in-parties-13th-jan-the-old-blue-last-london-tickets'>Old Blue Last: She's in Parties, Ellis•D, Tears at the Table, Ninush</a>

New music showcase organised by DIY magazine, the second of four this month. 
The big highlight for me is opener Ninush, and her lush folky chamber pop. Also on the lineup: She's in Parties are a dreamy indie group; Ellis•D is a glam punk artist, known and highly rated for his live performances; Tears at the table make moody jangly goth rock.

Three bands I love (and three completely different approaches to band name capitalisation). RABBITFOOT are equally groovy and theatrical, a really charismatic frontperson backed by a band of skilled musicians. green star are cool, wintery, harsh and pretty. G.R.S.M are an emotive slowcore band who play with patience and intention - when their songs hit their peaks you'll be in tears.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href = 'https://dice.fm/event/nvkal9-atomiser-new-year-new-time-14th-jan-avalon-cafe-london-tickets'> Avalon Cafe: Yorck Street, Sydenham High Road, Alba Akvama, Jæd, uv raymond</a>

New year's celebration from underground promoters Atomiser,  one of the most reliably interesting promoters in London (a favourite show I saw last year was an experimental guitarist and throat singer called Posuposu Otani who opened for The Coward at an Atomiser event). I'm only really familiar with Sydenham High Road from this lineup - they are raw, drawling and smoky, music made for walking around at night - but I checked out headliner Yorck Street's EP *My Small Piano* and it's brilliant - intimate, dreamy alt-pop that's twisted and broken-down in the right places.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/3og9ng-improvs-greatest-hits-no-clique-11-14th-jan-folklore-hoxton-london-tickets'>Folklore Hoxton: Improv’s Greatest Hits, No Clique #11</a> 

Improv's Greatest Hits' No Clique events bring together members of various London bands, from different scenes and subcultures, to play improvised sets in one-night-only configurations. I went for the first time at the end of last year, there was lots of great and interesting music and some fun and exciting style-clashes, but most importantly a really nice community feeling. You can find information about the musicians involved this time round at the ticket link.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/guest-event-skydaddy-presents-works-in-progress-tickets-1979661507861'>Theatreship: Skydaddy Presents 'Works in Progress'</a>

A night of unfinished work-in-progress material from some brilliant songwriters, on a ship in Canary Wharf and hosted by art-folk-rock baladdeer Skydaddy. This edition of Skydaddy's WIP series feels particulary stacked, you can find all the names involved at the ticket link - but I'll mention in particular Max Winter, who I've seen play a few times now and think is a really exciting and unique songwriter, I'm interested to see what his music sounds like in this stripped back format given the sets I've seen from him have involved lots of synths and sampling, as well as effected viola and trumpet.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/mxlorr-friend-crush-curated-by-daniel-avery-15th-jan-the-shacklewell-arms-london-tickets'>Shacklewell Arms: wing!, Dek, Pearl2 (Curated by Daniel Avery)</a>

This year's first edition of the Shacklewell's Friend Crush series, where they invite musicians & bands to curate a lineup of their favourite new artists. Electronic (and maybe now shoegaze-adjacent?) artist Daniel Avery has picked a sick and pretty tightly aligned lineup of three half electronic half live bands. wing! are one of the absolute best around right now, their sets are ecstatic, hypnotic and epic, Dek and Pearl2 are a bit darker and more acidic, but equally entrancing - Dek combine dreamy atmospherics with twinkly radar synths, while Pearl2 are pounding, glitchy and kind of acid-housey. This is a powerful trio.

3 more artists that The Line of Best Fit are singling out for 2026. Headlined by sean trelford, a psychadelic and classically trained songwriter & producer, check out his EP *ulcer* from the end of last year. Then there's Ain't, an indie rock band who write really great songs, I especially love their first single 'Oar'. Finally there's Morn, a Speedy Wunderground signed explosive post-punk band.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/av39v2-my-new-band-believe-2026-workshop-shows-16th-jan-the-george-tavern-london-tickets'>George Tavern: My New Band Believe, Drive Your Plow, Evelyn Gray</a>

My New Band Believe, led by Cameron Picton, have had a different lineup for virtually every one of their shows so far - the sound and instrumental makeup of the band on any given night is unpredictable, but the songs are consistently great and excecuted with loads of energy, groove and texture, drawing on elements of post-punk, salsa and folk music. They're supported here by Drive Your Plow, a sprawling art folk/jazz ensemble with some properly heartbreaking ballads (the one on piano in particular), they were part of mitj's picks for the aforementioned Friend Crush series last year. Also on the bill is singer-songwriter Evelyn Gray, ahead of an official launch gig for her new album in February (also at the George), Evelyn's new project is themed around 'documenting the rooms of an abandoned apartment block before its demolition', I'm really excited to hear it.

<a class='gig-tix' target = _blank href='https://www.eventbrite.com/e/luggs-release-party-start-stop-tickets-1979481364046?aff=oddtdtcreator'>Mascara Bar: Luggs, Lola</a>

Hard to find out much about the headliner Luggs, this is a launch show for their debut single, I think they're from Bristol and there's a description on a gig listing <a target= _blank href='https://www.headfirstbristol.co.uk/whats-on/the-old-england-pub/wed-29-jan-luggs-121186#e121186'> here  </a> which I think is describing them! . But there's lots of great reasons to go to this gig regardless. Lola is supporting, a really interesting artist who makes dark, mystical music, and had a music video shown at BFI Imax. Also, I love Masacara Bar as a venue, I wish there were more gigs there – it's such a weird & magical place. The excellent Dog Race are on DJ duties after the gig.

Here's a lovely little description of Modern Woman from a <a target=_blank href='https://soyoungmagazine.com/modern-woman-beauty-is-in-the-ear-of-observation/'> So Young</a> article on the band: 'Mindfully melding psychotic arrangements with the surrealist landscapes of social structures'. They're headlining a 2026 showcase on Saturday, organised by Bad Vibrations. I went to last week's edition with Maiden, Max Winter, Dek and Saint Jude - it was a great lineup top to bottom. Spanish Horses are on this bill, they've been gigging loads and gaining lots of fans since they moved to London from Paris last year. I'm especially excited for Jonique, Joni from Djank, and formerly Fraulein's new project. I loved a solo set from her that I saw last week at the Windmill and I'm looking forward to seeing her with a full band!

Co-promoted by the Windmill and independent Leeds record label Private Regcords. Headlined by Turnspit, who I haven't seen but sound great from this description: 'A duo from the DIY hotbed of Leeds with a cinematic, experimental take on electronica creating both intimate beats and a club-ready energy. Punters describe them as Long-bodied, crooked-legged, ugly dogs with a suspicious and unhappy look about them.' Joined by alt-pop singer/songwriter/producer MAY, podcaster/musician/legend multiscreen, and MM'99.

Another Shacklewell Friend Crush event, this time curated by Fat Dog. It's another very cohesive lineup: SILVERWINGKILLER are a loud, chaotic duo from Manchester with elements of acid house and digital hardcore; Star City are a techno-disco group who are Windmill stalwarts; Lttl Mrt is an awesome synth/drum duo who sound something like a mix of pulp and the prodigy.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://mascarabar.co.uk/events/2026/quintet-peter-zummo'>Mascara Bar: Quintet with Peter Zummo</a>

Peter Zummo is an avant garde trombonist, composer and band leader who was a long time creative partner of Arthur Russell, check out <a href='https://thequietus.com/interviews/peter-zummo-arthur-russell-interview/'>this great interview with The Quietus</a> discussing their relationship. His playing can be heard across Russell's whole discography, often supporting or playing counterpoint to the cello line – the two collaborated on probably entire days worth of released and unreleased music. Outside of his work with Arthur Russell, Zummo has been an extremely prolific artist and composer, making sparse, alien, blissful music. And you can see him at Masacara Bar! This Sunday! wow
