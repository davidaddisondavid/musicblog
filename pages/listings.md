# Jan 12 - 18

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/oeqmyg-senrab-sunglasz-vendor-the-wheel-2-sweetfish-12th-jan-windmill-brixton-london-tickets'>Windmill Brixton: senrab, Sunglasz Vendor, The Wheel 2!, Sweetfish</a>

January's Pindrop event at the Windmill! Always a great night run by great people, this time with a focus on emo. Headlined by Senrab: a 'stoner metal' band who have been organising screamo shows in warehouses across London. Also on the bill are Sunglasz Vendor - I saw them play with glasshouse red spider mite last year, they're frantic and angular with some great melodies. Finally, there's The Wheel 2! - a noisy manic prog ensemble - and a newly formed screamo band called Sweet Fish.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href= 'https://dice.fm/event/eobynw-hello-2026-shes-in-parties-13th-jan-the-old-blue-last-london-tickets'>Old Blue Last: She's in Parties, Ellis•D, Tears at the Table, Ninush</a>

New music showcase organised by DIY magazine, the second of four this month. 
The big highlight for me is opener Ninush, and her lush folky chamber pop. Also on the lineup: She's in Parties are a dreamy indie group; Ellis•D is a glam punk artist, known and highly rated for his live performances; Tears at the table make moody jangly goth rock.

**tix: free (but one in one out, rsvp if you can)**

My favourite lineup of the week, three bands I love (and three completely different approaches to band name capitalisation). RABBITFOOT are equally groovy and theatrical, a really charismatic frontperson backed by a band of skilled musicians. green star are cool, wintery, harsh and pretty. G.R.S.M are an emotive slowcore band who play with patience and intention - when their songs hit their peaks you'll be in tears.

**tix: £15 (more expensive, but worth it)**
