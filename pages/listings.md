<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/oeqmyg-senrab-sunglasz-vendor-the-wheel-2-sweetfish-12th-jan-windmill-brixton-london-tickets'>Windmill Brixton: senrab, Sunglasz Vendor, The Wheel 2!, Sweetfish</a>

January's Pindrop event at the Windmill! Always a great night run by great people, this time with a focus on emo. Headlined by Senrab: a 'stoner metal' band who have been organising screamo shows in warehouses across London. Also on the bill are Sunglasz Vendor - I saw them play with glasshouse red spider mite last year, they're frantic and angular with some great melodies. Finally, there's The Wheel 2! - a noisy manic prog ensemble - and a newly formed screamo band called Sweet Fish.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href= 'https://dice.fm/event/eobynw-hello-2026-shes-in-parties-13th-jan-the-old-blue-last-london-tickets'>Old Blue Last: She's in Parties, Ellis•D, Tears at the Table, Ninush</a>

New music showcase organised by DIY magazine, the second of four this month. 
The big highlight for me is opener Ninush, and her lush folky chamber pop. Also on the lineup: She's in Parties are a dreamy indie group; Ellis•D is a glam punk artist, known and highly rated for his live performances; Tears at the table make moody jangly goth rock.

My favourite lineup of the week, three bands I love (and three completely different approaches to band name capitalisation). RABBITFOOT are equally groovy and theatrical, a really charismatic frontperson backed by a band of skilled musicians. green star are cool, wintery, harsh and pretty. G.R.S.M are an emotive slowcore band who play with patience and intention - when their songs hit their peaks you'll be in tears.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href = 'https://dice.fm/event/nvkal9-atomiser-new-year-new-time-14th-jan-avalon-cafe-london-tickets'> Avalon Cafe: Yorck Street, Sydenham High Road, Alba Akvama, Jæd, uv raymond</a>

New year's celebration from underground promoters Atomiser,  one of the most reliably interesting promoters in London (a favourite show I saw last year was an experimental guitarist and throat singer called Posuposu Otani who opened for The Coward at an Atomiser event). I'm only really familiar with Sydenham High Road from this lineup - they are raw, drawling and smoky, music made for walking around at night - but I checked out headliner Yorck Street's EP *My Small Piano* and it's brilliant - intimate, dreamy alt-pop that's twisted and broken-down in the right places.

Improv's Greatest Hits' No Clique events bring together members of various London bands, from different scenes and subcultures, to play improvised sets in one-night-only configurations. I went for the first time at the end of last year, there was lots of great and interesting music and some fun and exciting style-clashes, but most importantly a really nice community feeling. You can find information about the musicians involved this time round at the ticket link.

A night of unfinished work-in-progress material from some brilliant songwriters, on a ship in Canary Wharf and hosted by art-folk-rock baladdeer Skydaddy. This edition of Skydaddy's WIP series feels particulary stacked, you can find all the names involved at the ticket link - but I'll mention in particular Max Winter, who I've seen play a few times now and think is a really exciting and unique songwriter, I'm interested to see what his music sounds like in this stripped back format given the sets I've seen from him have involved lots of synths and sampling, as well as effected viola and trumpet.

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/mxlorr-friend-crush-curated-by-daniel-avery-15th-jan-the-shacklewell-arms-london-tickets'>Shacklewell Arms: wing!, Dek, Pearl2 (Curated by Daniel Avery)</a>

This year's first edition of the Shacklewell's Friend Crush series, where they invite musicians & bands to curate a lineup of their favourite new artists. Electronic (and maybe now shoegaze-adjacent?) artist Daniel Avery has picked a sick and pretty tightly aligned lineup of three half electronic half live bands. wing! are one of the absolute best around right now, their sets are ecstatic, hypnotic and epic, Dek and Pearl2 are a bit darker and more acidic, but equally entrancing - Dek combine dreamy atmospherics with twinkly radar synths, while Pearl2 are pounding, glitchy and kind of acid-housey. This is a powerful trio.

3 more artists that The Line of Best Fit are singling out for 2026. Headlined by sean trelford, a psychadelic and classically trained songwriter & producer in the lofi Alex G style, check out his EP *ulcer* from the end of last year. Then there's Ain't, an indie rock band who write really great songs, I especially love their first single 'Oar'. Then finally there's Morn, a Speedy Wunderground signed explosive post-punk band.

Promoters *Our Mutual Friend* give a better description of these artists than I could hope to come up with, so I'll just paste it here! All I'd add is that Truthpaste's live set is one of the most fun and heartwarming around:<br>
<br>
'Our Mutual Friend is a regular night of the best new alternative music in the whole damn land. Truthpaste: Folk? Art Pop? Baroque Pop? Music! Great music! Sweeping, epic-scaled songs from one of the best new bands in town. Stanley Welch: Musician and composer from rural Cornwall, creating beautifully lush, textured tunes for fans of late period Talk Talk (who isn’t) and early Brian Eno et al. Kissing Gate: Rocking and rolling with violins, many members and impeccable songwriting, this is white hot alternative rock at its best. Followed by DJs until 2am'

<a class='gig-tix' target=_blank href='https://dice.fm/event/av39v2-my-new-band-believe-2026-workshop-shows-16th-jan-the-george-tavern-london-tickets'>George Tavern: My New Band Believe, Drive Your Plow, Evelyn Gray</a>

My New Band Believe, led by Cameron Picton, have had a different lineup for virtually every one of their shows so far - the sound and instrumental makeup of the band on any given night is unpredictable, but the songs are consistently great and excecuted with loads of energy, groove and texture, drawing on elements of post-punk, salsa and folk music. They're supported here by Drive Your Plow, a sprawling art folk/jazz ensemble with some properly heartbreaking ballads (the one on piano in particular), they were part of mitj's picks for the aforementioned Friend Crush series last year. Also on the bill is singer-songwriter Evelyn Gray, ahead of an official launch gig for her new album in February (also at the George), Evelyn's new project is themed around 'documenting the rooms of an abandoned apartment block before its demolition', I'm really excited to hear it.
